// Code SimplerComponent Here
// In the components/SimplerComponent.js file, create a SimplerComponent component.
// The component should be a "stateless functional" component.
// It should render a <div> to the page that contains the text: "I am just happy".
// If you open the index.js file, you'll see that SimplerComponent receives one prop called handleClick that is currently undefined. 
//Rewrite this prop to perform any action of your choice! Then, make sure SimplerComponent can trigger this action when it's clicked on.

import React from 'react'

const SimplerComponent = (props) => {
    
    return(
    <div onClick={props.handleClick}>
        I am just happy
    </div>
    )
}

export default SimplerComponent
